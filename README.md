# Nouva
As limitless as the unknown.

[NOUVA?] is an ever evolving 'language' that transcends traditional boundaries of language. It allows for the expression of both the known and the unknown, exploring the infinite spaces between the tangible and the imagined. 

Just like the unknown, it is limitless in its potential, capable of expressing the deepest emotions, the most abstract concepts, and the most complex creations. 

Its purpose is to be a system where complexities can be broken down to be better understood or things can be conbined to add complexity. the limits of reality can be pushed.
